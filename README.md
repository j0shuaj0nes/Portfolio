## Description

The motivation for this project was driven by the need to build an online space that could showcase my growth as a developer.
It serves this purpose by providing an easy access point to my ongoing work to fellow students, instructors/tutors and prospective employers.
This particular project was quite a big step forward for me. I really started to get a feel for how the tools I have learned in two very high paced weeks can be applied to create something practical and useful.
